# A Shiny App for Diagnosing & Triage of Patients to Urgent Endoscopy

This repository contains a Shiny application designed to help clinicians predict:

1. Source of bleeding (upper, mid, or lower GI).
2. Need for urgent endoscopy.
3. Appropriate patient disposition (ICU vs. non-ICU).

The tool uses Random Forest models trained on clinical data to provide probabilistic outputs for each prediction.
